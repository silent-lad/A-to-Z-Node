## What is it?
Here is a list of 26 alphabetically ordered npm packages which are hidden in dark. And can be used by you to make your life easier. I'm gonna stay away from biggies like Express, Mongoose, React, Vue etc. Just going to give the limelight to the batmans (the one we need but we don't deserve) of npm packages.

## A To Z :-

* [`Alex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/alex) - Whether your own or someone else's writing, alex helps you find gender favouring, polarising, race-related, religion inconsiderate, or another unequal phrasing in the text. For example, when We've confirmed his identity is given to alex, it will warn you and suggest using their instead of his.
* [Brain.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/brain.js) - Brain.js is a library of Neural Networks written in JavaScript.
Who said python is a must for machine learning and artificial intelligence, watch out for javascript.
* [`Carbon-now-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/carbon-now-cli) - Have you ever seen the beautiful screenshots of code we bloggers use? ITS CARBONâ€¦and guess what it has a cli tool based on Javascript too. Which lets you download screenshots of files in your local directory so that you don't need to open your browser.
